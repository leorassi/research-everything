Opeartions Research is to solve real-world problems with analytical methologies. "That's almost everything!" someone might say. Yes, it is everything. 

The motivation behind creating this repo is to incorporate what I learned back at [Cornell ORIE](https://www.orie.cornell.edu/orie) a decade ago and what I am researching now at [TBSI](http://www.tbsi.edu.cn/). By sharing knowledge and know-hows, it will promote communication with other scholars and students.
