### Green’s Dictionary of Slang
Green’s Dictionary of Slang is a great slang dictionary. For the paper book version, it's as thick as three(3) volumes. For the online version, it used to charge a subscription fee, but now it has decided [to go free](https://blog.greensdictofslang.com/news/2018/greens-dictionary-of-slang-to-go-free)! 
首先搜索便利，可以随意搜索也可以按字母浏览，鼠标指上去就能显示具体的词条。其次，例证极其丰富，而且做的超专业，每个词或短语按其不同意思分开，每种意思都详细研究查找每一个例子都有引证的出处，并给出时间轴，也就是说可以基本看出这个俚语是否过时了。最后，这词典不光是收英美俚语，它还收入了大量澳大利亚、新西兰、南非等说英文国家的俚语，并且在例子中都标注了不同的国旗。所以这部网上在线词典也可用来做英语俚语的学术研究都是非常好的工具和语料库
